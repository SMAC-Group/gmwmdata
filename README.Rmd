# `imudata` Overview <a href="https://smac-group.com/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%"/></a>

This package is meant to serve as a data collection tool for IMU data. This data can be used as a means to assess and test methods designed to analyse IMU error signals (i.e. long and complex autocorrelated signals). An example method used for this kind of data is implemented in the `gmwm` R package which can also model the latent models that often characterize this data.

The datasets available within the package are:

* `imu6` - A MTi-G MEMS-IMU dataset with 6 columns corresponding to the stochastic error measurements coming from the X, Y and Z axes for gyroscopes and accelerometers respectively and taken from a sensor calibrated in stationary conditions for 2 hours at 100Hz.
* `cont.imu1` - A MTi-G MEMS-IMU dataset with 1 column corresponding to the stochastic error measurements coming from the X-axis gyroscope and taken from a sensor calibrated in stationary conditions for 2 hours at 100Hz and possibly suffering from some contaminated measurements (e.g. outliers).
* `navchip` -  A Navchip MEMS-IMU dataset with 6 columns, Axis: X,Y,Z - Type: Gyroscope & Accelerometer, from a stationary sensor run for 4 Hours
* `imar.gyro` - An IMAR MEMS-IMU dataset with 3 columns, Axis: X,Y,Z - Type: Accelerometer, from a stationary sensor run for 4 Hours
* `ln200.gyro` - A LN200 MEMS-IMU dataset with 3 columns, Axis: X,Y,Z - Type: Gyroscope, from a stationary sensor run for 6 Hours
* `ln200.accel` - A LN200 MEMS-IMU dataset with 3 columns, Axis: X,Y,Z - Type: Accelerometer, from a stationary sensor run for 6 Hours
* ADD MISSING DATASETS

The first 6 datasets can be used as examples for the functions `auto.imu()`, `gmwm.imu()`, `wvar.imu()`, and `imu()` of the `gmwm` R package. Note that the `cont.imu1` data can be used as an illustration of the robustness properties of the robust version the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM). Here is a simple example:
