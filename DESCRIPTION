Title: Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) Data Package
Description: This package is meant to serve as a data collection tool for IMU data. 
 This data can be used as a means to assess and test methods designed to analyse 
 IMU error signals (i.e. long and complex autocorrelated signals). An example method
 used for this kind of data is implemented in the GMWM R package which can also model 
 the latent models that often characterize this data.
